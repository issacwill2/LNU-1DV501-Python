ASSIGNMENT 2 VG

9, Countdigits.py
To find out how many zero, odd and even do we have in a line of digits. I have
used 'for loop' and 'if' statement that can help me to count out (zero, even & odd).

10, Birthday_Candle.py 
I firstly created 4 varibles which contain the (remained_candle, all_boxes,buy,
candles_in_box). I have also used 'for loop', 'while' and 'if' statement

14,  abcd.py
I use return function with 4 parameters and give them zero to intiate with while they
become arguments and later on I have used 'nested for loop' and 'if' statement. To get
abcd*4 = dcba.

15, pi_approx.py
Firstly import 'pi' and 'sqrt' from math and 'uniform' from 'random'. Continuesly
I created varibles to contain zero(orign), min and max of (x & y). And the made functions
to get called later to print out the 'apprximation of pi for 100, 10000 and 1 000 000'.
And finally the error.

21, salary_revision.py
By importing median from statistics, I let the user(s) to provide amount of salaries and
splited it. Then I have used 'for loop' in range of len(length) of the str(provided
salaries). Later on to find the (average and gap) I used division and subtraction.

22, drunken_sailor.py
I begin to import randit from random and return function that will later be called to
the user to prove the digits size, step and sailors. I use two varible that contain
the value of zero by the beginning and used 'for loop' before I print it out used
multiplication and division to figure out the percentage.
