12, sumofthree.py
To be able to add the digits I need to convert it to "int" so that could be counted separetly and 
create different variables before I add the digits with each other to find the sum (total).

13, cahnge.py
Firstly I used simple formula to figure out the change = (payment - price). continuesly I worked to 
find out what notes and/or coins. By using the change to module the notes to get the remainder
later on I divide by the one step bigger notes than the given one. eg. kr500 = change % 1000 // 500
print("500kr bills: ",kr500).

19, tax.py
I use "if" statement to distinguish the three different percentage of paying taxes. The 
first one is simply belonges to the "if" when it is less than 38000 and multiplied with 0.3(30%). 
I used interval which belongs to first "elif" 38000 < income < 50000 and multiplied with 5% tax more 
than the first one and the last "elif" includes that greater than 50000 and add 5% on the top of
last one.

20, squarcolor.py
I took randomly (b5) as an example relation between a letter and digit of the chessboard. I 
separated (b5) using indexes eg. [0] & [-1] meaning first and last index and converted to integer 
at the same time. I finally used two variables horizontal and vertical which can help me to contain 
the value of "ld"(letter&digit) and "letter" (the letters) so that I'm able to execute the process 
by using "if" statement (result % 2 ==1) so I get black otherwise (else) white. Because I had 
already used (+1) to distinguish black and white.
